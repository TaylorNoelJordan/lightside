# Light Side

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This app demonstrates basic React principles that allows a user to characters, planets, and vehicles from the Star Wars series. The page opens with the classic scrolling text that begins each movie, with a button for the user to enter the site. Upon entering, the user may select a category with items to view, select, remove and view favorites, and read more details on each item.

### Set Up

To access this page, start by cloning down this repository by pasting this in your command line :
> git clone https://github.com/pgoulding/lightside.git

CD into the directory and run `npm install`.

`npm start` will start up the React server and you'll see the site in action.
